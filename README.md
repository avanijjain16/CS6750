# Alarm Clock Application with Object Challenge Feature

The alarm clock application has a unique functionality designed to motivate users to get out of bed by presenting them with a challenge. This feature is optional, and users can choose to enable it using a toggle button on the alarm set screen.

## Object Challenge Setting

To make use of the object challenge, users need to set the objects they wish to scan during the alarm ring. They can personalize this feature by selecting the objects they find motivating or enjoyable to interact with.

## Alarm Buzz and Actions

Once the object challenge setting is completed, users will wait until the alarm buzzes at the set time. When the alarm goes off, users have two options:

1. Turn Off Alarm: If users choose to turn off the alarm, they will face the object challenge. They need to solve the challenge to stop the alarm from ringing.

2. Snooze: Users can also choose to snooze the alarm. However, there is a limit to the number of times they can snooze, with a maximum of three snoozes allowed.

## Object Challenge when Snooze Limit is Reached

If users reach the maximum snooze limit of three times, they will face the object challenge once again to turn off the alarm.

## Unable to Solve Object Challenge

In case users find it difficult to solve the object challenge, the alarm will persistently keep buzzing until the challenge is successfully completed. This encourages users to actively engage with the challenge and get out of bed.

Please note that this feature is meant to provide an interactive and motivating experience to users, making the waking up process more enjoyable and effective.
